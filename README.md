# The Shoppies

This app was bootstrapped with Create-React-App and utilizes the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to let users search OMDb for movies to nominate to The Shoppies. To install the app on your machine, clone the repo and run `npm install` in your terminal.

## Features

The application takes in movie titles and returns that movie (or a list of movies, if it is a more general search term), and lets the user nominate that movie to The Shoppies. Local storage is also utilized to save any nominees that the user has selected (in case a user navigates away from the page).

The deployed version of the application can be found [here](https://mh-shoppies.netlify.app), hosted on Netlify.
